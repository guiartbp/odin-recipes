    <ul>
        <li>1 pound dry black beans</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
        <li>4 ounces slab bacon</li>
        <li>1 pound pork ribs</li>
        <li>2 Mexican chorizo sausages</li>
        <li>1 smoked sausage</li>
        <li>1 large onion</li>
        <li>4 cloves garlic</li>
        <li>3 tomatoes</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>3 bay leaves</li>
        <li>water</li>
        <li>white rice</li>
        <li>farofa</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large bowl with water, soak beans overnight</li>
        <li>When you are ready to make your stew, in a large heavy-bottom soup pot, over medium heat, add the oil and bacon. Cook until crisp and transfer to a plate</li>
        <li>Use the same saucepan to brown ribs and sausages in batches. (You will want to be sure to cook the sliced Mexican chorizo on its own, as it can be very greasy. Drain the grease before continuing.) Set each aside as cooked</li>
        <li>If needed, add more oil to the pan. On medium-high, saut√© onion and garlic until soft and translucent, about 5 minutes. Add tomatoes and cook for another 3 minutes</li>
        <li>Drain and rinse the soaked beans. Add them to the pot along with the ribs, bacon, sausages, salt, pepper, bay leaf. Cover with water (about 8 cups)</li>
        <li>Bring the mixture to a boil and reduce the heat to low. Cover and let it cook for 2 to 2 and a half hours, or until the beans are soft</li>
        <li>If the stew is too liquidy, uncover the saucepan and continue to cook for another 20 minutes to allow some of the liquid to evaporate</li>
        <li>Serve with white rice and sprinkle some farofa on top.</li>
    </ol>
